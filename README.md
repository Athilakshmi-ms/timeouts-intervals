### setTimeout() function

The setTimeout function allows you to execute a function in the future. This function takes two arguments:

- The function to execute 
- The time, in milliseconds (thousandths of a second), the timer should wait before the specified function or code is executed.

### setInterval() function

- The setInterval is another way to call a function multiple times. It works exactly like setTimeout except, the function is called repetitively.

### Clearing timers

- You can cancel any previously set interval or timeout, using clearTimeout or clearInterval.
